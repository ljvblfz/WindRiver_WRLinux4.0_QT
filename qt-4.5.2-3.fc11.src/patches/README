This directory contains patches for Qt that haven't been accepted by TrollTech
yet. All patches in this directory itself shouldn't make qt-copy incompatible
to official Qt, patches adding new API etc. belong to the notsafe/
subdirectory.

When adding new patches, use the same naming scheme for naming the patch file,
i.e. <next available number>-<some suitable name>.<patch extension>.
The number is used to order applying of the patches in the apply_patches
script, in case they depend on each other. The extension should be either
".diff" or ".patch". Also, include the following header:

qt-bugs@ issue : <number>
Trolltech task ID : <number>
bugs.kde.org number : <number>
applied: <no/yes>
author: <who to blame for the thing :) >
os: <unix | win> (optional: os on which the patch schould be applied)
<description of the patch - the qt-bugs@ mail will do>

The patch should be created from the toplevel directory, so that
'patch -p0' in the toplevel directory can apply it.

If you want to include more information that shouldn't be in the patch
itself, create another file with the same file name, just use a different
extension. E.g. if you want to include whole qt-copy@ mail, but the mail
contains two patches and you want only one of them to be applied, put
the mail in 1234-mypatch.txt, and in file 1234-mypatch.diff put only
the header, perhaps very short description, and the patch to be applied.

The apply_patches script will apply patches that have 'applied: no'
in the header (first 5 lines). When adding a new patch, you should apply it
to qt-copy (in SVN) only if it's a bugfix - optimizations, new features etc.
shouldn't be applied, so that people need to apply those patches explicitly
by running the apply_patches script, and will be aware of the fact that their
qt build differs from the official Qt.
